### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned that JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation it is a syntax for storing and exchanging data, is lightweight data interchange format, is a subset of JavaScript, is language independent, and is "self-describing" and easy to understand.
2. I learned that the JSON datatypes are: Number, String, Boolean, Array, Object, Value, and null.
3. I learned that Ajax allows client web pages to quickly interact and exchange data with a web server without reloading the entire web page. Also that Ajax relies on programming language such as JavaScript and data interchange format such as JSON or XML.
